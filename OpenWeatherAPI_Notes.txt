We can request hour by hour time for up to 5 days in the past using this call:
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall/timemachine?lat=40.18&lon=-83.09&dt={EPOCH TIME HERE - e.g. 1594627200}&appid={API KEY HERE}

I'm not sure the best way to handle and aggregate all this data.
This will return hour by hour data for that date with the following format, abbreviated for brevity:
